# Synthetic-Bank-Dataset

# Introduction
The **Bank Household Analysis Dashboard** is designed to assist banks and financial institutions in gaining a deeper understanding of their customer base by providing a comprehensive, interactive view of key demographic and financial metrics. By analyzing aspects like age, income, and credit scores, this dashboard enables institutions to tailor their products and services to better meet the specific needs of diverse customer segments.

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of data analysis in real-world banking scenarios through an intuitive, user-friendly interface. The dashboard allows users to explore various elements of customer data, including:
- **Customer Distribution Across States**: Identify where the majority of the bank's clients are located.
- **Income and Credit Score Analysis**: Understand how income and credit scores differ across regions.
- **Household Detection**: Discover how customers are grouped into households and analyze their combined financial health.

Developed as my midterm project, the **Bank Household Analysis Dashboard** uses an interactive Streamlit app to help banks analyze customer data, identify household structures, and uncover demographic insights. The dashboard enables users to explore key metrics like income, age, and credit scores, while visualizing patterns across different states. With features such as dynamic filtering, household detection based on shared addresses, and diverse visualizations, the app simplifies the understanding of customer distribution and collective financial health. This project showcases my proficiency in data processing, visualization, and the development of interactive web applications using tools like Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit. It serves as a practical example of how data analysis can drive real-world banking decisions by providing clearer insights into customer behavior and trends.
